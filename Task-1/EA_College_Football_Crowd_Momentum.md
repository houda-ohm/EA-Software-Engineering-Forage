**EA Sports College Football – Feature Proposal (Forage Software Engineering Program)**

**Author: Ismail Muhammad**

**Feature Proposal: Crowd Momentum System**

**Overview**

The Crowd Momentum System models stadium energy where fan reactions influence on-field
performance. Loud cheering, chants, and crowd intensity can trigger temporary boosts or disruptions,
making home-field advantage truly impactful and reflecting the emotional core of college football.

**Objectives & Value**

* Authenticity: Captures the passion of college crowds and the '12th-man' effect.
* Strategy: Momentum swings reward clutch plays and disciplined coaching.
* Engagement: Adds narrative weight to comebacks, turnovers, and rivalry moments.

**Key Mechanics**

* Team Momentum Meter fills on impactful events (TDs, sacks, interceptions, 4th-down stops).
* Home-Field Advantage scales meter gain and audio intensity for the home team.
* Gameplay effects: High momentum grants focus or confidence buffs (quicker reads, cleaner routes);
hostile noise can cause visiting miscommunications (missed audibles, occasional false starts).
* Interactive presentation: Adaptive crowd audio, dynamic camera shake at peaks, and on-screen
overlays communicate state without clutter.

**Example Gameplay Scenario**

Down four late in Q4, the home defense snags an interception. The crowd erupts, the meter spikes,
and the defense receives a short-term awareness boost while the visiting offense struggles with
snap timing amid deafening noise. The swing flips the game’s outcome.

**Technical Considerations**

* Implementation: Event listeners publish momentum updates; audio mixer layers chants/volume
by meter thresholds; temporary attribute modifiers apply via existing gameplay systems;
accessibility option to limit camera shake/noise.
* Testing: Ensure momentum benefits do not snowball excessively; simulate CPU vs CPU games
with varied teams/stadium sizes; telemetry to calibrate thresholds post-launch.
